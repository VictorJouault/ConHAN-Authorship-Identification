# ConHAN: Contextualized Hierarchical Attention Networks for Authorship Identification

## Abstract

Authorship identification is a common and im- portant task in the field of Natural Language Processing. Defined as the task of predicting the author of a given text, it enables us to ac- complish a broad range of tasks, from identify- ing ghost writers to detecting plagiarism. We show the advantages of using neural network architectures over classic machine learning ap- proaches in terms of accuracy. We first re- produce literature approaches which we bench- mark on the Reuters 50 50 dataset, and then improve on them by introducing ConHAN, a new deep learning architecture combining pre-trained contextualized embeddings (Distil- BERT) and a hierarchical attention architec- ture. Among all models we tested, the best model achieves an out-of-sample accuracy of 78%, compared to the literature benchmark of 69%. Despite a small training size, ConHAN shows promising results on this particular task and we firmly believe it would benefit from a bigger training set. We further analyze our model and discover that ConHAN performs best when predicting authors with simple vo- cabularies, but it is agnostic to many sentencesâ€™ grammatical differences.
